## How It Works

1. **Connect to the Traderâ€™s Wallet**: The bot listens for transactions from a selected trader's wallet and monitors their actions on the Solana blockchain.
2. **Track and Replicate Trades**: Once the trader makes a trade (buying or selling a token), the bot mirrors the exact same transaction in your wallet, ensuring you're always in sync with their actions.
3. **Automatic Execution**: The bot handles the execution of trades, meaning you don't need to constantly monitor the market. You can fully automate your trading based on your chosen traderâ€™s activity.
4. **Custom Strategy**: Customize your copy trading experience by setting your desired risk level, token preferences, and execution strategies.
